This is a work-in progress Discord Bot. (Written in typescript)

Why I made this bot.
I made this bot mainly to check out new functionalities of DiscordAPI

Currently the functionalities of the bot are quite simple.
we used discord slash commands and have a total of 4 commands.
Coinflip as you can guess flips a coin of heads or tails.
SortTeam command is an algorithm I made to sort 10 players into a team
